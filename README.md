# Stack-using-List-in-python
This project implements a Stack data structure using a Python list. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.  

Features:
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
Peek: View the top element without removing it.
Is Empty: Check if the stack is empty.
Size: Get the number of elements in the stack.
